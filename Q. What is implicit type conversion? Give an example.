Q. What is implicit type conversion? Give an example.

A. Implicit type conversion, also called type coercion, JavaScript converts one data type to another during operations.
   let result = "7" + 3;
   console.log(result); // output : 73
  "7" is a string
   3 is a number
   JavaScript sees a string + number, so it converts the number to a string

          Result: "7" + "3" â†’ "73" (string)
