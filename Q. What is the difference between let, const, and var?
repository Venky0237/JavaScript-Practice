Q. What is the difference between let, const, and var?
A : const: used to initialize constant values,
           Const cannot be reassigned

var: used to initialize variables
     var can be both reassigned and redeclared

let: used to initialize variables (this is a new method of initialization)
     let can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope
