Q.Explain the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types with examples.
A. When you declare a primitive with const, the variable canâ€™t be reassigned, but the value itself (like a number or string) is inherently immutable anyway,
Arrays and objects can be declared with const but their contents can still change.
   // Primitive
   //  let num = 10;
   // num = 20;
           // reassignment changes the value, but original value 10 can't be changed

  // Non-Primitive (Array)
  // let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  // arr.push(4);  // array contents changed, no reassignment needed
  //   console.log(arr); 
      // [1, 2, 3, 4]
